## Introduction
Pomodoro is a very well-known technique, especially among students. It's based on a system of time blocks, which determine a period of intense focus and two periods of rest, one being slightly longer than the other.
In the original Pomodoro, you have a 25-minute focus period, followed by a short 5-minute break. After four repetitions, take a 15-minute break to relax and do some other simpler activities.

## Features
- Visual timer shown on screen
- Sound notifications for the start/pause button and for the end of the periods
- Naruto themed
- Deployed on Vercel for easy access
